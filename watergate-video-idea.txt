What does gate mean in the context like pizza-gate?

"Pizzagate" is a conspiracy theory that emerged during the 2016 United States presidential election. The theory alleged that a child sex trafficking ring was being run out of the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C. and that high-ranking officials, including Hillary Clinton, were involved.

The "gate" suffix in "Pizzagate" is derived from the Watergate scandal, which was a political scandal in the 1970s that ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Since then, the "-gate" suffix has been used to refer to any political scandal, even if it has nothing to do with the original Watergate scandal. So, "Pizzagate" is simply a name given to this particular conspiracy theory, with the "-gate" suffix indicating that it involves a scandal or controversy.

Why is that site called researchgate?

ResearchGate is a social networking site that allows researchers to share and collaborate on research projects. The site's name is a combination of the words "research" and "gate," with the "gate" suffix referring to a portal or entrance.

The founders of ResearchGate wanted to create a platform that would allow researchers to connect with one another and share their work more easily, essentially creating a "gateway" to collaborative research. The site offers features such as the ability to share research papers, ask and answer questions related to research, and network with other researchers in one's field of study.

The name "ResearchGate" is therefore a fitting choice for a platform that seeks to be the online gateway to the research community.

What is the etymology of the work gate?

The word "gate" has its origins in Old English, where it was spelled "geat" or "gat." It referred to an opening or passage in a wall, fence, or other barrier that could be closed with a movable barrier, such as a door or gate.

The Old English word "geat" is related to the Old Norse word "gat," which also means "gate" or "opening." The Proto-Germanic word from which both of these words derive is "gatan," which meant "to go" or "to walk." This is because a gate was often a point of entry or exit for people and animals.

Over time, the spelling of "geat" or "gat" evolved into the modern English spelling of "gate," which is still used today to refer to an opening or entrance that can be closed with a movable barrier. The word "gate" is also used in other contexts, such as in the names of streets, cities, and landmarks, to indicate a particular entrance or point of access.
