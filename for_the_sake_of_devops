While it is possible for a DevOps engineer to automate themselves out of a job,
it is not necessarily a given that operations and developers will take over the role.
In many cases, a good DevOps engineer will have created tools and processes that are 
integrated into the overall software development lifecycle, and that are crucial
to the ongoing success and maintenance of the system.

Even if a DevOps engineer has automated much of their work, there will still be 
ongoing maintenance and optimization that is required to ensure that the system 
continues to function effectively. Additionally, as software systems continue to evolve and grow,
there will always be a need for ongoing development and improvement,
which may require the input and expertise of a DevOps engineer.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the role of a DevOps engineer is constantly evolving,
and new tools and technologies are emerging all the time.
This means that even if a DevOps engineer has automated certain aspects of their work,
there will always be new challenges and opportunities to apply their expertise 
and continue to add value to the organization.

Overall, while it is possible for a DevOps engineer to automate themselves out of a job,
it is not a given that operations and developers will take over the role.
Instead, the role of a DevOps engineer will continue to evolve and adapt to the
changing needs of software development, and those who are able to stay current 
and add value to their organizations will continue to be in high demand.
